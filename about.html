      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        Binoy Dey is a doctoral scholar in the School of Basic Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar. His research interests include quantum dynamics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and computational materials chemistry. He is currently involved in simulating light‚Äìmatter interactions in molecular systems using quantum chemical and wavepacket dynamics approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        He earned his Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Chemistry from IIT Bhubaneswar in 2024, where he worked under the supervision of Dr. Kousik Samanta on the topic <em>‚ÄúComputational Approach to Optoelectronic Enhancements in Cs‚ÇÇAgBiI‚ÇÜ Perovskite.‚Äù</em> During this time, he developed strong expertise in density functional theory (DFT) and many-body electronic structure methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to joining IIT Bhubaneswar, he completed his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. Honours) in Chemistry from Chandernagore College (affiliated to the University of Burdwan), West Bengal, in 2022. He has consistently demonstrated academic excellence throughout his educational career, securing high merit scores in both secondary and higher secondary examinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Binoy has a keen interest in code development and scientific computing. He is proficient in Python, Fortran, and Linux environments, and actively engages in developing custom scientific codes for molecular simulations. His broader academic pursuits also include attending interdisciplinary seminars, participating in research workshops, and staying updated with emerging literature in theoretical and computational chemistry.
